# Janitra.Bot

JanitraBot is the test runner for [Janitra](https://github.com/danzel/Janitra/).

It downloads the set of tests from Janitra, runs those it can and submits the results.

It should be able to be ran long term without maintenance for a dedicated test running server, or as a single run when someone wants to submit a test result for a game they own.
